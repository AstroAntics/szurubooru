everything related to users:
    - banning
    - show link to user's uploads
    - show link to user's favs
    - show link to user's liked posts
    - better avatar loading

everything related to tags:
    - tag listing
    - tag autocompletion (difficult)
    - time of last tag usage
    - time of tag addition
    - mass tag
    - tag merging
    - editing tags

everything related to comments:
    - adding comments
    - listing comments in post view
    - listing comments in comment list view
    - deleting
    - editing
    - markdown
    - score (see notes about scoring)

refactors:
    - centralize markdown prefix decorators
    - add enum validation in IValidatables (needs refactors of enums and
      possible disposal of EnumHelper in favor of something more subtle)
    - (idea) keep denormalized data in separate tables, i.e. tag usages in
      tag_meta or post favorite count in post_meta, so that it's obvious what
      can be recalculated on demand and what is real data
    - change AbstractSearchService to AbstractSearchParser
    - embed AbstractSearchService into Dao (it sucks to include XSearchService
      together with Dao)
    - simplify template loading in presenters - right now template loading
      requires _, util and promise:
          promise.wait(util.loadTemplate('blah'))
              .then(function(html) {
                  template = _.template(html); });
    - change content spinner to nprogress:
      http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/

miscellaneous:
    - fix mouse trap hotkeys when leaving page
    - add hotkeys for focusing items in top navigation
    - add ability to select tags text in tag input
    - pasting tags should "soft-add" latest word in clipboard to input
    - pasting tags should have protection against very long clipboard content
    - add protection against ridiculously long tag names
    - add customizable favicon
    - add customizable logo
    - add log engine and log everything that should be logged
        - I don't think browsing online logs is very necessary
    - add help, api documentation
    - add version on homepage that reads version from package.json and git hash
    - add tool for migrating szurubooru database
    - endless pager should include information about page number
    - add README - apache2 has good README:
      http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/README
    - add spinner to forms such as registration, user query, login, settings
      etc. make sure the code isn't too duplicated.

notes about scoring:
    - anonymous users should be able to score posts
    - anonymous users should be able to revoke and correct their scores
    - it should be difficult to score post repeatedly (add protection in local
      storage, anything more is probably an overkill)
    - scored of authorized users should be persisted into database so it can be
      searched for with special:liked and special:disliked

some day:
    - configure mails and ensure it works with gmail
