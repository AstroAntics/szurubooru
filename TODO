refactors:
    - add enum validation in IValidatables (needs refactors of enums and
      possible disposal of EnumHelper in favor of something more subtle)
    - (idea) keep denormalized data in separate tables, i.e. tag usages in
      tag_meta or post favorite count in post_meta, so that it's obvious what
      can be recalculated on demand and what is real data
    - simplify template loading in presenters - right now template loading
      requires _, util and promise:
          promise.wait(util.loadTemplate('blah'))
              .then(function(html) {
                  template = _.template(html); });
    - change content spinner to nprogress:
      http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/
    - add fetchUsers to PostSearchFilter: when AbstractDao fetches entities
      with query decorated by PostDao::decorateQueryFromFilter, call
      PostDao::decorateEntitiesWithFilter that will optimally load users and
      inject them using posts' lazy loaders.
    - reduce dependencies

miscellaneous:
    - fix mouse trap hotkeys when leaving page
    - add hotkeys for focusing items in top navigation
    - add ability to select tags text in tag input

    - pasting tags should have protection against very long clipboard content
    - add protection against ridiculously long tag names
    - add customizable favicon
    - add customizable logo
    - add log engine and log everything that should be logged
        - I don't think browsing online logs is very necessary
    - add help, api documentation
    - add version on homepage that reads version from package.json and git hash
    - add tool for migrating szurubooru database
    - endless pager should include information about page number
    - add README - apache2 has good README:
      http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/README
    - add spinner to forms such as registration, user query, login, settings
      etc. make sure the code isn't too duplicated.
