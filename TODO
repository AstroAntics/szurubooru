This is transient file that lists functionalities to be implemented before
first major release.

everything related to posts:
    - post listing
        - better thumbnail loading
        - comment count
        - regard safety settings
        - regard disliked settings

            - image_size:huge/large/medium/small
        - search order
            - order:comment_count
            - order:comment_time
            - order:random (at least unstable version)

    - single post view
        - previous and next post (difficult)
            - remember last search
            - take care of pages
            - add A/D hotkeys

    - ability to paste many urls in post upload

    - post notes
        - "add note" in sidebar creates new note in the middle of image
        - hovering notes shows note text
        - dragging and resizing notes is always possible
        - clicking note reveals modal popup with textarea to input text
        - under textarea there are buttons for saving and/or deleting the note.
        - post notes should have separate table and shouldn't be stored as json
          column.
        - post notes should be visible in post edit history.
          (move post snapshot factory methods to PostService)

everything related to users:
    - show link to user's uploads
    - show link to user's favs
    - show link to user's liked posts
    - better avatar loading

everything related to tags:
    - tag listing
    - tag autocompletion (difficult)
    - time of last tag usage
    - time of tag addition
    - mass tag
    - tag merging
    - editing tags
        - tag relations
        - tag aliases
        - tag categories (from config.ini)
        - tag descriptions
        - tag edit history

everything related to comments:
    - adding comments
    - listing comments in post view
    - listing comments in comment list view
    - deleting
    - editing
    - markdown
    - score

refactors:
    - add enum validation in IValidatables (needs refactors of enums and
      possible disposal of EnumHelper in favor of something more subtle)
    - (idea) keep denormalized data in separate tables, i.e. tag usages in
      tag_meta or post favorite count in post_meta, so that it's obvious what
      can be recalculated on demand and what is real data
    - simplify template loading in presenters - right now template loading
      requires _, util and promise:
          promise.wait(util.loadTemplate('blah'))
              .then(function(html) {
                  template = _.template(html); });
    - change content spinner to nprogress:
      http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/
    - reduce dependencies

miscellaneous:
    - endless pager should include information about page number
    - add customizable favicon
    - add customizable logo
    - add log engine and log everything that should be logged
        - I don't think browsing online logs is very necessary
    - add help, api documentation
    - add version on homepage that reads version from package.json and git hash
    - add tool for migrating szurubooru database
    - add README - apache2 has good README:
      http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/README
    - add spinner to forms such as registration, user query, login, settings
      etc. make sure the code isn't too duplicated.
    - add 404 pages

some day:
    - configure mails and ensure it works with gmail
    - configure HTTPS
