# Stored information

Posts, comments, favorites and ratings linked to your account will be stored in the site&rsquo;s database and publicly available.

The "Upload anonymously" option allows you to post content without linking it to your account - meaning your nickname will not be stored in the database nor shown in the "Uploader" field.

Your actions related to posts (uploading, tagging, etc.) are logged, along with your nickname and IP.
